**Password Generator**

For our second assignment, we were given the challenge of creating a Password Gnerators using Javascript. I created this generator from scratch with all new code. This application uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript that we having been learning over the course of the bootcamp thus far. 

This application does the following, 

- User clicks on the "Generate Password" function.
-  User inputs how many characters they would like the password to be.
- Prompts will be available to the user so they can determine whether they would like numbers, uppercase, lowercase and special characters in the password.
- Once prompts are followed through, a new and secure password will generate and copy and pasted as needed.
